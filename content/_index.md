        My journey in Computer Science has been driven by a deep passion for problem-solving. While working on my undergraduate thesis, I discovered the exciting world of computer science research. This experience was transformative â€“ it showed me how my competitive programming background could evolve into meaningful research contributions.

        What excites most me about research is finding elegant solutions to complex problems that affects us in our day-to-day life.

        Currently, I'm channeling my enthusiasm by mentoring young competitive programmers while preparing for my PhD. I'm eager to connect with researchers and potential advisors! ðŸš€
